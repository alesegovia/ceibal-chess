ceibal-chess
============

A chess game for the Sugar (OLPC) environment.

This project consists in creating a Chess activity for the Sugar environment to teach kids the basic rules of the game and allow them to play with one another and against the CPU.

Ceibal-Chess differs from other projects in that it aims to produce a chess Activity for the Sugar and the XO that is free as in Freedom, allowing kids to explore its source code, modify it and redistribute it freely.
